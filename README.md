# Data-Science-Task1---Sparks-foundation

This is task 1 from the set of tasks provided by the Sparks Foundation.
I performed this using python.
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

Making use of the given dataset of a student which includes no. of hours a student studies and the corresponding scores obtained. Our task is to develop a linear regression model to predict the score of the student based on the total amount of hours invested by him in studying for that particular test.
